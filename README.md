### GoalüöÄ
The goal of this visualization platform is to help bank senior managers to understand banks' daily financial and business work, make strategies based on data or adjust banks' critical indicators.

### Features:
1. **Interactive dashboard**: the website includes four pages--Overview, Finance, Business, and Prediction--in which users can interact with this interface. Basic operations include selection, entering expected number, and filtering.
